## Project Description:newspaper:
 
In computer science, a search algorithm is any algorithm which solves the search problem, namely, to retrieve information stored within some data structure, or calculated in the search space of a problem domain, either with discrete or continuous values

You will be asked to write files containing big O notations.
```
O(1)
O(n)
O(n!)
n*m -> O(nm)
n square -> O(n^2)
sqrt n -> O(sqrt(n))
log(n) -> O(log(n))
n * log(n) -> O(nlog(n))
```
